# Shopping WebApp by Manvinderjit

A Vite-React Webapp e-commerce portal allows customers to purchase products. It makes use of Bootstrap 5, React Bootstrap, React Redux, React Router Dom, and JWT technologies.

Is a part of a two-app ecosystem for an organization selling computer hardware. Leverages RESTful APIs provided by the [Inventory Management App](https://ia.manvinderjit.com/), which is the other app in the ecosystem. 

The app ecosystem consists of two user roles:
- `Customers:` They use this [Shopping App](https://2023-top-project-shopping-cart.pages.dev/) to place orders.
- `Employees`: They use the [Inventory App](https://ia.manvinderjit.com) to perform inventory and logistics operations, including processing orders received through this `Shopping App`. Promos and products displayed on the `Shopping App` are also managed through the `Inventory App`.
